## Who We Are  

At Restoration Lab, we believe that true wellness stems from a balanced musculoskeletal system. Our founders, Dr. Kathleen and Dr. Alicia, are licensed Naprapaths with years of clinical experience treating a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions—from chronic back pain and sports injuries to everyday tension and postural strain. Their shared commitment to evidence‑based care and personalized treatment forms the cornerstone of our clinic.

## What Is Naprapathy?  

Naprapathy is a manual therapy that focuses on the connective tissues, muscles, ligaments, tendons, fascia, and joints to restore proper alignment, mobility, and function. By assessing structural imbalances and applying precise soft‑tissue techniques, Naprapaths aim to:

- Reduce pain and inflammation
- Improve range of motion and flexibility
- Enhance circulation and nerve function
- Promote the body’s natural healing processes

Unlike many short‑term fixes, Naprapathy addresses the root causes of discomfort, helping the body maintain optimal biomechanics over the long term.

## Our Approach  

1. **Comprehensive Assessment** – We begin each visit with a thorough evaluation of posture, movement patterns, and medical history to pinpoint the underlying issues.  
2. **Tailored Treatment Plans** – Using a blend of soft‑tissue manipulation, stretching, ergonomic advice, and therapeutic exercises, we create individualized plans that fit your lifestyle and goals.  
3. **Education & Empowerment** – We equip you with practical self‑care strategies—home stretches, posture tips, and lifestyle adjustments—so you can sustain improvements outside the clinic.  
4. **Ongoing Support** – Regular follow‑ups ensure progress is tracked, adjustments are made as needed, and you stay motivated on your path to better health.

## Why Choose Restoration Lab?  

- **Local Expertise** – As Albuquerque‑based practitioners, we understand the unique demands of our community, from outdoor recreation to daily commuting stresses.  
- **Holistic Focus** – We view each person as a whole, integrating Naprapathic care with nutrition, movement, and stress‑management guidance when appropriate.  
- **Patient‑First Philosophy** – Your comfort, safety, and long‑term outcomes guide every decision we make.  
- **State‑of‑the‑Art Facility** – Our clinic offers a welcoming environment equipped with modern treatment tables, ergonomic assessment tools, and a calm space for recovery.
